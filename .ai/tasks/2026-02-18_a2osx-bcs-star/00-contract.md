# Task Contract

**Task ID:** 2026-02-18_a2osx-bcs-star
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Requestor:** User
**Assigned Role:** Spelunker
**Workflow:** Research

---

## Task Description

Use the A2osX Makefile to test assembly and identify the actual current failure.

### Background and Context

Previous investigations pointed at wrong files (expression_parser.cpp). SCMASM already handles `*` operator correctly at scmasm_syntax.cpp:830-846. We need to test with the actual A2osX Makefile to see what the real current error is.

### Current State

- A2osX has a Makefile at ~/Projects/Vintage/Apple/A2osX/Makefile
- Previous manual test showed failure at line 77 with `bcs *`
- But SCMASM code shows `*` should work
- Need to use the Makefile to see actual current error

### Desired State

- Know the actual current assembly error when using the Makefile
- Understand if error is still at line 77 or has progressed
- Identify the real root cause (not speculative)

---

## Success Criteria

Define objective, measurable criteria for completion:

```
✓ Run: cd ~/Projects/Vintage/Apple/A2osX && make clean && make
✓ Capture the actual error output from xasm++
✓ Identify which line fails (may not be 77 anymore)
✓ Identify what instruction/directive fails
✓ Document the actual error message verbatim
```

**CRITICAL STEP 1 (run this exact command):**
```bash
cd /Users/bryanw/Projects/Vintage/Apple/A2osX && make clean && make 2>&1
```

**Then:**
2. Capture the error output from the command above
3. Identify which line fails in A2osX.S.txt
4. Document the actual error message verbatim

## Estimated Complexity

**Complexity:** [Trivial | Small | Medium | Large | Very Large]

**Rationale:**
- Number of files affected: [X]
- Lines of code estimate: [~X]
- New concepts/patterns: [Yes/No]
- Integration complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]

---

## Lean Flow Analysis (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Prevent token limit failures and verification chaos (see `principles/LEAN-FLOW.md`)

### Batch Size Assessment

**Estimated Files:** [X files]

**Batch Size Evaluation:**
```
File Count Assessment:
├─ 1-5 files   → ✅ IDEAL: Small batch, proceed
├─ 6-14 files  → ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE: Document decomposition consideration
├─ 15-26 files → ❌ TOO LARGE: MUST decompose into 2-3 task packets
└─ 27+ files   → ❌ CRITICAL: MUST decompose into 3+ task packets

Your Task: [X files] → [Status]
```

**If 15+ files, MANDATORY decomposition:**
```markdown
### Decomposition Plan

This task is too large (X files) and MUST be decomposed:

**Subtask 1:** [Name] ([Y] files)
- Files: [list]
- Estimated tokens: ~[Y × 3000] tokens
- Dependencies: [None | Depends on X]

**Subtask 2:** [Name] ([Y] files)
- Files: [list]
- Estimated tokens: ~[Y × 3000] tokens
- Dependencies: [Depends on Subtask 1]

[Add more subtasks as needed]

**Execution Strategy:**
- Sequential (dependencies) OR Parallel (independent)
- WIP Limit: Max 3 spawned agents simultaneously
```

**If 6-14 files, document reasoning:**
```markdown
### Batch Size Justification

Files: [X] (within acceptable range but requires justification)

**Why not decomposed further:**
- [Reason: High cohesion - all files tightly coupled]
- [Reason: Single concern - one logical unit]
- [Reason: Already minimal viable batch]

**Contingency for token limits:**
- [If token limit hit, will decompose into: X + Y]

**Estimated tokens:** ~[X × 3000] = [total] tokens
**Status:** Within 25K-32K limit? [Yes/No]
```

### Token Budget Estimation

**Conservative Estimate:**
```
Files × Average Tokens Per File = Estimated Total
[X] × 3,000 tokens = [total] tokens

Agent Output Limit: 25K-32K tokens

Status:
├─ <20K tokens → ✅ SAFE
├─ 20-25K tokens → ⚠️ APPROACHING LIMIT
├─ 25-42K tokens → ❌ HIGH RISK (40% failure probability)
└─ >42K tokens → ❌ GUARANTEED FAILURE

Your Task: [total] tokens → [Status]
```

**If >42K tokens:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Token budget risk

REQUIRED ACTION: Decompose task into smaller batches

Target: Each batch ≤42K tokens (≤14 files)
```

### Work In Progress (WIP) Planning

**Concurrent Execution Assessment:**
```
How many spawned agents will run simultaneously?

├─ 1 agent → ✅ IDEAL (complete before next)
├─ 2-3 agents → ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (within limits)
└─ 4+ agents → ❌ EXCEEDS LIMIT (verification chaos)

Planned WIP: [X agents]
```

**If planning parallel execution:**
```markdown
### Parallel Execution Plan

**Agents to spawn:** [X]
**WIP limit:** Maximum 3 concurrent spawned agents

**Agent 1:** [Task description]
- Files: [list]
- Estimated tokens: [X]
- Dependencies: [None]

**Agent 2:** [Task description]
- Files: [list]
- Estimated tokens: [X]
- Dependencies: [None | Depends on Agent 1]

[If >3 agents, MUST decompose or run sequentially]

**Coordination Strategy:**
- [How will shared resources be managed?]
- [Execution order if sequential?]
- [Verification approach?]
```

### Decomposition Decision

**Final Assessment:**

**Proceed as single task packet?**
- [ ] YES - Batch size ≤14 files AND token budget ≤42K AND WIP ≤3
- [ ] NO - MUST decompose (batch >14 files OR tokens >42K OR WIP >3)

**If NO, decomposition is MANDATORY:**
```markdown
See Decomposition Plan above.
Each subtask created as separate task packet.
Cannot proceed until decomposed.
```
